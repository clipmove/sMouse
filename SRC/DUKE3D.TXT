Duke Nukem 3D supports only 3 analog degrees of freedom, these are:

  analog_turning (yaw)
  analog_moving (translation in z)
  analog_strafing (translation in x)

All other control must be accomplished through the button states.

There are 2048 units in 360 degrees in DN3D.

1 DN3D unit corresponds to 32 control units.
DN3D limits your maximum change in yaw per frame to 127 units.
This put's an effective maximum on analog_turning of +/- 4064 control
units.  The normal keyboard turning speed in DN3D is 30 DN3D units and 60
DN3D units while holding down the "run" button.

1 DN3D analog_moving unit corresponds to 64 control units.
DN3D limits your maximum change in z per frame to 90 units.
This put's an effective maximum on analog_moving of +/- 5760 control
units.  The normal keyboard move speed in DN3D is 40 DN3D units (2560
control units) and 80 DN3D units (5120 control units) while holding down
the "run" button.

1 DN3D analog_strafing unit corresponds to 1 control unit.
DN3D limits your maximum change in x per frame to 90 units.
This put's an effective maximum on analog_strafing of +/- 90 control
units.  The normal keyboard strafe speed in DN3D is 40 DN3D units (40
control units) and 80 DN3D units (80 control units) while holding down the
"run" button.

When "Mouse Aiming" is active in DN3D all analog_moving information will
be intercepted by DN3D and used to control the pitch of the character.
